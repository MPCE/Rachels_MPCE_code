To do next: 
*add drop shadows
*note: probably I don't even want a force-directed network eventually. Something more static with nice curved lines and nodes grouped in some sensible way? Could be approximated by using multiple centres for the different groups, I guess.
*add sticky drag? And pan/zoom?
