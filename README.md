# MPCE
scripts and code for the MPCE project

Currently this includes two main things:

1. A visual interface for seeing the structure of the MPCE database and generating query code so people like Simon without SQL can see how it works.

2. A machine learning experiment for auto-classifying book genres based on titles. (Using Google Colab notebook)


*VISUAL INTERFACE*
Test link: https://rhendery.github.io/MPCE/network.html

To do next: 
*zoom/pan not working and I don't know why
*make arrows turn blue too
*sort out arrow sizes better
*cascade the sidebar selecting logic

*BOOK GENRE CLASSIFIER*
To do next:
*test general approach on larger corpus such as excerpt from MLA to see whether our low-ish accuracy is due to lack of training data or something else.
