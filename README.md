# MPCE
scripts and code for the MPCE project

Test link: https://rhendery.github.io/MPCE/network.html

To do next: 
*put in boundaries at edge of page
*size nodes based on number of connections
*rotate line labels as in http://bl.ocks.org/fancellu/2c782394602a93921faff74e594d1bb1
*place arrows better see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37594919/d3js-force-directed-arrows-do-not-appear-at-the-end-of-path
*add drop shadows
*note: probably I don't even want a force-directed network eventually. Something more static with nice curved lines and nodes grouped in some sensible way? Could be approximated by using multiple centres for the different groups, I guess.
*add sticky drag? And pan/zoom?
